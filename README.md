# **Customer Churn Prediction Project**

This repository contains a customer churn prediction project. The project includes the following:

* A Jupyter Notebook which follows the typical machine learning pipeline to develop a model.
* A pickle file which contains the trained XGBoost Classifier model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not
* A Streamlit web application that allows users to interact with the model and make predictions.
* A project report

**To use the project:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the Streamlit app using the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Open the Streamlit app in your web browser at http://localhost:8501

**To make a prediction:**

1. Enter the customer's information in the input fields
2. Click the "Predict" button
3. The model will predict whether the customer is likely to churn or not

**Future work:**

* Gather more data
* Explore advanced techniques
* Segment customers
* Develop real-time churn prediction
* Incorporate churn prediction into business processes

**Contributions are welcome!**
